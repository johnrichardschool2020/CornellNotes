            <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include an object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.</p>
            <p>Keywords: C++, Drivers, Kernels, Games, GUI, Desktop Apps</p>

            <h2>Introduction to C#</h2>
            <p>C# is the most common programming language used to develop multiple applications in the .NET framework, and it was introduced by Microsoft in 2000. It was designed to be a simple, object-oriented programming language that can be used to create a wide range of applications and software. It features a clear syntax, an object-oriented nature, and platform independence, which makes it simpler for developers to organize their code and makes it more legible and manageable. It is platform-independent in the sense that it may be used to create programs that operate on different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. This makes C# a versatile language.</p>
            <p>Keywords: C#, Net.Framework, Microsoft, 2000, Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile devices</p>
            <p>C# is a popular and simple-to-learn programming language with a large community and plain syntax. C# is an object-oriented programming language that makes code more structured, reusable, and interoperable with other languages. C# is a versatile programming language that can be used to create a broad variety of applications, including games, apps, websites, and advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
            <p>JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.</p>
            <p>Keywords: Java, James Gosling, Sun Microsystems Inc, 1995, Oracle Corporation</p>
            <p>Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first coffee (named java coffee) was produced. And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is just a name, not an acronym.</p>
